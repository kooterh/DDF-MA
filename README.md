# DDF-MA for localting adaptive stitching traces in cropped speech
Implementation of the method proposed in "Locating Adaptive Stitching Traces in Cropped Speech with Dual-domain Deep Features and Multi-head Attention" with tensorflow(1.6.0, gpu version). 

CASSD (Cropped and Automatically Stitched Speech Dataset), the source codes, and the trained model will be public after the paper is accepted.
